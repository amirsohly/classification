# classification
This code snippet demonstrates the usage of TensorFlow and Keras libraries to create and train a neural network model for a binary classification task.
Overall, this code demonstrates the process of building a neural network model, compiling it, training it on a dataset, and evaluating its performance for a binary classification task.

## 1
It imports the necessary libraries: tensorflow, keras, and other related modules.
## 2
It creates a sequential model using Sequential() from keras.models.
## 3
It adds layers to the model using model.add(). In this case, two dense layers with 32 units and ReLU activation function are added, followed by a dense layer with 1 unit and sigmoid activation function.
## 4
It compiles the model using model.compile(). The optimizer is set to stochastic gradient descent ('sgd'), the loss function is set to binary cross-entropy, and accuracy is chosen as the evaluation metric.
## 5
It prints a summary of the model using model.summary().
## 6
It uses plot_model from keras.utils.vis_utils to visualize the model architecture.
## 7
It loads a dataset from a CSV file using pd.read_csv().
## 8
It preprocesses the dataset by separating the input features (X) and the target variable (Y).
## 9
It performs feature scaling on the input features using preprocessing.MinMaxScaler().
## 10
It splits the dataset into training, validation, and test sets using train_test_split() from sklearn.model_selection.
## 11
It prints the shapes of the training, validation, and test sets.
## 12
It trains the model using model.fit(). The training data (X_train and Y_train) is used with a batch size of 32 and 100 epochs. The validation data (X_val and Y_val) is used for validation during training.
## 13
It evaluates the model's performance on the test set using model.evaluate() and prints the accuracy.
## 14
It imports matplotlib.pyplot as plt for visualization purposes.
